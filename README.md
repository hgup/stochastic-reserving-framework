# Stochastic Reserving Framework

> Tooling for Actuarial Reserving needs


The challenge: how to make a framework that brings down operations to a very simple level while balancing between these two:
- Should not be too specific, else will not generalize for every situation
- Should not be too generic, else would be equivalent to doing things from scratch

## Fundamental Semantics and Operations

- [ ] Data Aggregation (Accident years, policy years etc.)
- [ ] Large Events & Anomaly Detection
- [ ] One-time change considerations
- [ ] Trending operations
- [ ] Insurance Components

## Basic (Traditional) Methods

- [ ] Chain Ladder
- [ ] Expected Claims Method
- [ ] Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method
- [ ] Cape Cod Method
- [ ] Frequency-Severity Techniques
- [ ] Case Outstanding Development
- [ ] Berquist-Sherman Techniques
- [ ] Evaluation
